# Movie Rating Analysis Project

### Overview

This project analyzes movie ratings using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The analysis is performed on the IMDb dataset spanning from 1920 to 2020.

### Dataset

The IMDb dataset used in this project covers movies released between 1920 and 2020. It includes various attributes such as movie title, release year, genre, rating, director, and more. The dataset is sourced from IMDb Datasets.

### Analysis

The project explores the following aspects:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data formatting, and filtering relevant data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, trends, and relationships among variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Statistical Analysis: Utilizing NumPy for numerical computations and statistical tests.
Machine Learning: Applying Scikit-learn for building predictive models or clustering analysis (if applicable).
Libraries Used

NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.
